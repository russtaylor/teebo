A Ruby gem that encompasses a wide array of data-generation functionality. It's
made to generate high-quality data, which goes beyond mere randomness by
properly weighting results according to the biases found in real-world datasets.

Currently, it's just in the beginning stages. In the works are data generation
tools for names, but more coming is data according to normal distributions,
Benford's law, nationalities, document generation, etc.
